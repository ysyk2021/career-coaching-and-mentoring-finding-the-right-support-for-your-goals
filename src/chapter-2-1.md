Definition of Career Coaching and Mentoring
-------------------------------------------

Career coaching and mentoring are both forms of professional development that aim to support individuals in achieving their career goals. While there are some similarities between the two, there are also some key differences.

**Career Coaching**: Career coaching is a process of helping individuals identify and achieve their career goals through personalized guidance and support. A career coach may help individuals identify their strengths and weaknesses, set achievable goals, develop new skills or competencies, and navigate challenging situations in their careers.

**Mentoring**: Mentoring involves a more experienced individual providing guidance, advice, and support to a less experienced individual. A mentor may provide feedback on performance, offer career advice, and share their own experiences and insights.
